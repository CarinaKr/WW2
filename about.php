				Welcome to our website about some of the main events of World War 2! <br><br>
				Going to "Home" you will find an interactive card, which displays operations, battles and divisions
				of World War 2. Click on each icon to see further details of each event and select a different year 
				with the slider at the bottom of the page. <br>
				Going to "Tanks" or "Ships" you will find tables of the tanks and ships which were used in World War 2.<br>
				<br>
				This website was created as part of a part of the course "Relationale Datenbanken" at the university of 
				applied sciences in Hamburg. Therefore the aim of this website, was not only to give people a simple 
				overview over World War 2, but mainly to learn about imbedding large amount of data via datatables into
				a web application.<br>
				The website is developed with HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript and a MySQL Database. <br>
				In addition we used the frameworks "Leaflet", for the interactive card, and "DataTables", for the Data Tables in
				"Tanks" and "Ships".<br><br>
				Have fun exploring this website!<br><br>
				Please excuse any possible historical inaccuracies that may appear on our website.
